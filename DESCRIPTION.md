## Overview

**The Last Crusade** is an adrenaline-fueled 2D survival game built with **Pygame** and **Tiled**. Traverse a procedural world teeming with hazards, recruit powerful abilities, and face escalating threats culminating in an epic showdown against the Elite Orc.

Players must master both melee and ranged combat while managing cooldowns, leveling up, and strategically choosing class specializations to endure relentless waves of enemies.

## üîë Key Features

* **Dynamic Sprite Management**: Layered sprite groups (`AllSprites`, `CollisionSprites`, etc.) with a camera system to always keep the action centered.
* **Fluid Combat System**:

  * **Melee Attacks**: Left-click swings with queued animations.
  * **Ranged & Special Attacks**: Right-click casts spells or fires projectiles with cooldown management.
* **Replayable Progression**: EXP-based leveling with scalable health, damage, and skill unlocks.
* **Class Specialization**: Choose **Knight**, **Wizard**, or **Judiciar** at level 15, each offering unique stat buffs and ultimate abilities.
* **Run Logging & Analytics**: Session data (username, duration, class, level, miniboss kills, win/lose) is stored in `runs.csv` for future leaderboards or analytics.

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Map & Exploration**

   * Designed in **Tiled**, each map layer is parsed into collision, decoration, and interaction sprites.
   * Collect health potions and EXP orbs dropped by enemies.

2. **Experience & Leveling**

   * EXP requirements follow a growth formula: `next_level_exp = base_exp * (growth_rate ^ (current_level - 1))`.
   * Upon leveling:

     * Max health resets and increases.
     * Damage output scales.
     * Access to new skills at milestone levels.

3. **Combat Flow**

   * Input buffering ensures responsive attack chains.
   * Cooldowns and animation queues prevent input locking.
   * Visual feedback via particle effects and sound cues.

* **Game Loop**: Defined in `main.py`, orchestrating event handling, updates, and rendering.
